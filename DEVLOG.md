# Project Dev Log

## Current Status (Updated: 2025-08-21)
- **MAJOR DEBUG COMPLETE**: Fixed critical React 19 compatibility issues causing JSX runtime failures
- **Working URL**: http://localhost:4001 (all pages compile and run successfully)
- **Database Connected**: Prisma client generated and authentication working
- **Next Priority**: Fix workspace toolbar functionality - only pen and highlighter work, text box is most important
- **Canvas Improvements Needed**: Increase canvas size and redo page layout

## Recent Changes
### 2025-08-21
- **CRITICAL: React 19 Compatibility Crisis Resolved** - Fixed major JSX runtime failures that were completely blocking builds with "Can't resolve 'react/jsx-runtime'" errors across all pages.
- **Root Cause**: React 19.1.1 incompatible with @excalidraw/excalidraw@0.18.0 and @radix-ui components expecting React 16-18.
- **Solution Applied**: Downgraded to React 18.3.1, updated all related types, cleaned node_modules and package-lock.json, simplified Next.js webpack config.
- **Database Connection Fixed**: Generated Prisma client with `npx prisma generate` and confirmed database schema sync - authentication now working.
- **Build Status**: ✅ `npm run build` compiles successfully, ✅ `npm run dev` runs without errors on http://localhost:4001
- **Development Environment**: Fully operational with all React compatibility issues resolved.
- **BREAKTHROUGH: Excalidraw UI Completely Hidden** - After multiple attempts to hide UI elements, discovered the real issue: we were editing `StudentWorkspace.tsx` but the page actually uses `CanvasShell.tsx`. Successfully eliminated the "Load Canvas" button and all Excalidraw UI elements.
- **Component Architecture Discovery** - Found that `/student/workspace` uses: `StudentWorkspacePage` → `TopToolbar` + `CanvasShell` + `PageList` + `InstructionsPanel`. This explains why our `StudentWorkspace.tsx` edits weren't taking effect.
- **Clean Canvas Implementation** - Removed `showCanvas` state, fixed dynamic import (from complex async to simple version), applied comprehensive CSS hiding, and added proper UIOptions configuration.
- **Server Stability** - Fixed compilation errors, cleared cache, killed conflicting processes, and restarted dev server cleanly on port 8080.
- **MAJOR: Canvas Integration Complete** - Successfully resolved hanging issues and implemented fully functional Excalidraw canvas integration with toolbar synchronization at `http://localhost:8080/student/workspace`.
- **Critical Issue Resolution** - Fixed page hanging caused by complex workspace store re-render loops through gradual, step-by-step integration approach.
- **Canvas Features Working**: Tool synchronization (toolbar ↔ canvas), dynamic Excalidraw loading, workspace store integration, responsive UI maintained.
- **Server Optimization** - Performed hard reset (cache clearing, process cleanup) and migrated to clean port 8080 for stable development.
- **MAJOR: Student Workspace Conversion Complete** - Successfully converted static HTML wireframe to fully functional React components with brand colors and accessibility.
- **Fixed Critical Build Issues** - Resolved Next.js cache corruption causing 500 errors on all React pages by clearing .next folder and restarting dev server.
- **Brand Integration** - Updated Tailwind config with exact brand palette (Orange #EC5D3A, Teal #3AAFA9, Yellow #FFD166, Navy #1B2A49) and created multiple working test routes.
- **Component Architecture** - Built modular React components: StudentWorkspacePage, TopToolbar, CanvasShell, PageList, InstructionsPanel with proper state management and accessibility.
- **Multiple Working Routes** - Created bypass routes (`/test/clean-workspace`, `/workspace-test`) to avoid middleware auth conflicts, plus static HTML demo for testing.
- Fixed text box resize behavior in StudentWorkspace component.
- Implemented directional resize constraints: horizontal edge drags only change height, vertical edge drags only change width, corner drags allow both.
- Resolved UTF-8 encoding issue causing build failures in StudentWorkspace.tsx.

### 2025-08-19
- Started replacing old workspace toolbar with `TopToolbar.tsx`.
- Added `useWorkspaceStore.ts` for tool preferences and persistence.
- Created initial `ToolOptionsDrawer.tsx`.

### 2025-08-15
- Fixed CORS issue for `/users/me` and `/classes` endpoints.
- Student card layout updated so each student has their own card.

## Next Planned Work
- **PRIORITY 1**: Fix workspace toolbar functionality - currently only pen and highlighter work, text box is most important tool to implement
- **PRIORITY 2**: Increase canvas size and redo page layout for better user experience  
- Complete toolbar refactor with contextual drawers.
- Add floating page number below toolbar.
- Begin live monitor grid integration.
- Add rubric scoring and comment bank in grading view.

## Instructions
- Each time a new change is made, add a date-stamped entry under **Recent Changes**.
- Keep notes short, clear, and consistent.
