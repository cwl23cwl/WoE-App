# Project Dev Log

## Current Status (Updated: 2025-08-21)
- **Canvas UI Integration Complete**: Successfully eliminated all Excalidraw UI elements and load button
- **Working URL**: http://localhost:8080/student/workspace (clean canvas loads immediately)
- **Next Priority**: Connect TopToolbar component to CanvasShell for tool functionality (pencil, text, highlighter)
- **Architecture Clarified**: Page uses StudentWorkspacePage → TopToolbar + CanvasShell (not StudentWorkspace.tsx)

## Recent Changes
### 2025-08-21
- **BREAKTHROUGH: Excalidraw UI Completely Hidden** - After multiple attempts to hide UI elements, discovered the real issue: we were editing `StudentWorkspace.tsx` but the page actually uses `CanvasShell.tsx`. Successfully eliminated the "Load Canvas" button and all Excalidraw UI elements.
- **Component Architecture Discovery** - Found that `/student/workspace` uses: `StudentWorkspacePage` → `TopToolbar` + `CanvasShell` + `PageList` + `InstructionsPanel`. This explains why our `StudentWorkspace.tsx` edits weren't taking effect.
- **Clean Canvas Implementation** - Removed `showCanvas` state, fixed dynamic import (from complex async to simple version), applied comprehensive CSS hiding, and added proper UIOptions configuration.
- **Server Stability** - Fixed compilation errors, cleared cache, killed conflicting processes, and restarted dev server cleanly on port 8080.
- **MAJOR: Canvas Integration Complete** - Successfully resolved hanging issues and implemented fully functional Excalidraw canvas integration with toolbar synchronization at `http://localhost:8080/student/workspace`.
- **Critical Issue Resolution** - Fixed page hanging caused by complex workspace store re-render loops through gradual, step-by-step integration approach.
- **Canvas Features Working**: Tool synchronization (toolbar ↔ canvas), dynamic Excalidraw loading, workspace store integration, responsive UI maintained.
- **Server Optimization** - Performed hard reset (cache clearing, process cleanup) and migrated to clean port 8080 for stable development.
- **MAJOR: Student Workspace Conversion Complete** - Successfully converted static HTML wireframe to fully functional React components with brand colors and accessibility.
- **Fixed Critical Build Issues** - Resolved Next.js cache corruption causing 500 errors on all React pages by clearing .next folder and restarting dev server.
- **Brand Integration** - Updated Tailwind config with exact brand palette (Orange #EC5D3A, Teal #3AAFA9, Yellow #FFD166, Navy #1B2A49) and created multiple working test routes.
- **Component Architecture** - Built modular React components: StudentWorkspacePage, TopToolbar, CanvasShell, PageList, InstructionsPanel with proper state management and accessibility.
- **Multiple Working Routes** - Created bypass routes (`/test/clean-workspace`, `/workspace-test`) to avoid middleware auth conflicts, plus static HTML demo for testing.
- Fixed text box resize behavior in StudentWorkspace component.
- Implemented directional resize constraints: horizontal edge drags only change height, vertical edge drags only change width, corner drags allow both.
- Resolved UTF-8 encoding issue causing build failures in StudentWorkspace.tsx.

### 2025-08-19
- Started replacing old workspace toolbar with `TopToolbar.tsx`.
- Added `useWorkspaceStore.ts` for tool preferences and persistence.
- Created initial `ToolOptionsDrawer.tsx`.

### 2025-08-15
- Fixed CORS issue for `/users/me` and `/classes` endpoints.
- Student card layout updated so each student has their own card.

## Next Planned Work
- Complete toolbar refactor with contextual drawers.
- Add floating page number below toolbar.
- Begin live monitor grid integration.
- Add rubric scoring and comment bank in grading view.

## Instructions
- Each time a new change is made, add a date-stamped entry under **Recent Changes**.
- Keep notes short, clear, and consistent.
